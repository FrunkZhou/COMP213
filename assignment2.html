	<h1>Frank's COMP213 Web Page</h1>
	<p>Here's to a semester of fun and learning. I hope to get a good grasp of basic HTML
	and CSS syntax, create basic to intermediary designed web pages, as well as improve
	my ability to create front-end web content.</p>
	<!-- Above is what I plan to learn throughout the semester -->
	<p>"Heroes are people who face down their fears. It is that simple. A child afraid of the dark who one day blows out the candle; a woman terrified of the pain of childbirth who says, 'It is time to become a mother'. Heroism does not always live on the battlefield." - David Gemmell</p>
