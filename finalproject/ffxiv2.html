	<p>If there's any MMORPG that can give WoW a run for its money, it's the Final Fantasy franchise. An upgrade from FFXI, FFXIV is a completely different game than what it was
	when it was first released. Originally released in 2010, the game was met with heavy criticism and negative reviews due to its stale content, horrible server uptimes, and large amount
	of bugs and glitches, among other things. Under the direction of Naoki Yoshida, the game underwent a rebirth under a new expansion, released in 2013, and have since been hailed
	as one of the best MMORPGs in the world. With the Final Fantasy franchise under its belt, the game is able to pull content from its other series to keep a myriad of content updates
	available for its users. The customization available in the game from glamours, personal housing, and a unique crafting system is what allows the game to deserve its high praise
	from game critics and fans alike. Having its second expansion released in June 2017, the game is currently focused on mini-patches to slowly add more in-game content, as well as adding
	QoL updates that the community has long been asking for.</p>
