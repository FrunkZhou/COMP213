	<p>Maplestory 2 is a special one on this list as it has not been released in North America yet. Following its predecessor Maplestory 1, MS2 is similar only in name. The game
	has evolved to become a block-based 3-D world, similar to that of Minecraft, removing the 3rd dimension limitations that the original game often had in terms of content.
	Although it has been released for about 2 years in Korea and China, the closed beta release of Maplestory 2 in NA was only recently announced mid-April in 2018, set for early May. Speculations
	are that a public release is set during the beginning to Summer to capture students coming back from school. MS2 is all about customization, and a large part of its selling point is the customization
	players can make towards housing and outfits, where players are able to create and upload their own designs to be flaunted in game. Keep an eye on this game, as MS2 may be deemed the flavour of the month, with
	many older wanting to give the game a try following a nostalgia-filled MS1 from a decade ago.</p>
