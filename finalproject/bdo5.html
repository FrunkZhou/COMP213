	<p>Black Desert Online is one of those games that used its hype to generate its initial player base. Created and first released in Korea, it was known as THE game for players who enjoy 
	a grind (Korean gaming culture revolves around grinding for progression). The game has an uncapped level feature that allows players the potential to continue gaining stats and strength
	without a hard cap, although it gets exponentially harder to level as you progress through the contents. BDO is considered a sand-box MMORPG in that the player is free to choose to do whatever they desire,
	and with the added combat system where dodging and aiming is all done manually, one can see the type of playerbase this MMORPG will attract. Something to note however is that BDO uses a different payment model
	depending on the game's region. In Asia, BDO follows a free to play with microtransactions model, while its NA servers follow a buy to play model. While the game is unique in its combat and content delivery,
	a lack of serious content updates is worrying for the game's future.</p>
